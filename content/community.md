a list of community organizing 

## 2022
- [**Reâ€¦searching our relationship to land**](https://www.instagram.com/re_searching_land/), *Supported with $10,000 by [4RS Youth Movement](https://4rsyouth.ca/)*
I co-designed a hybrid program for self-identified land-based researchers to explore decolonization and reconciliation. It was pretty much a book club. The best part about this was getting to learn alongside Indigenous knowledge holders and actually feel like I could work towards the abstract concept that is "reconciliation". I think about this experience a lot, to this day.

## 2021
- [**Momentum Mentorship Program**](https://www.instagram.com/momentumyvr/), *Supported with $10,000 by [UBC Centre for Community Engaged Learning](https://ccel.ubc.ca/), [CityHive](https://cityhive.ca/)*
I co-designed a hybrid program for 8 youth of colour and 4 mentors in Metro Vancouver. I'm really grateful for the ability to have connected with other racialized youth, and that mentors exist to help pave the way forward.
