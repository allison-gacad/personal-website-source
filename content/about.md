Hey, I’m Allison. I’m a writer, reporter, and very-briefly-technologist. I care deeply about building and supporting climate solutions, especially for our most marginalized populations. I think a lot about the role of technology in our society in a changing climate and have spent some time building technology, being critical of what we’ve built, and dreaming about its future, primarily through the domain of our food system.

I currently work in tech journalism as a writer for the Vancouver Tech Journal (sometimes Victoria and Calgary too). I cover hyper-local tech news, with a particular interest in climatetech. I'm interested in the ways technology intersect with politics and capital, particularly as we tackle the present and forthcoming impacts of a changing climate.

I’m excited and open to opportunities and conversations that advance new ways of building technology to address our climate crisis, especially if they focus on our food system. 

I was born and raised in scarborough - on the eastern edge of toronto - and graduated from the university of british columbia where I studied plant biology, agroecology, and food systems. This is all thanks to the support of many generous communities: the musqueam, squamish and tsleil waututh peoples; the loran scholars foundation; UBC’s global resource systems; the cansbridge fellowship; shipping container farms of singapore, rice fields of the philippines, the green rooftops and gardens across turtle island, the city of vancouver’s generous bike lanes; crag developers in squamish; mountains, oceans, and forest; my family, friends, partner, and my ancestors in the philippines

### as of recent...
- I'm training for a Triple Crown, which is a bit of a Vancouver cyclist hat trick summitting the three local mountains (2300 metres or 7500 ft in elevation)

### random things that i am thinking about...
- how my attention span is trash and yours probably is too and we've all normalized it somehow ??
- carbon markets
- being nostalgic about my [travel blog](http://www.adventuringallison.wordress.com)
