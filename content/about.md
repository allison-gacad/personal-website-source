Hey, I’m Allison. I’m a writer, reporter, and very-briefly-technologist. I care deeply about building and supporting climate solutions, especially for our most marginalized populations. I think a lot about the role of finance and technology in our society in a changing climate and have spent some time building technology, being critical of what we’ve built, and dreaming about its future.

I currently work in climate journalism as a correspondent for Carbon Pulse, where I cover carbon markets, climatetech, and policy. I largely report on market-based mechanisms as solutions for climate change (cap and trade programs, voluntary carbon credits etc) but am fundamentally interested in the ways technology intersects with politics and capital, particularly as we tackle the present and forthcoming impacts of a changing climate.

Previously, I was a writer at the Vancouver Tech Journal (sometimes Victoria and Calgary too), where I covered hyper-local tech news, with a particular interest in climatetech.

I’m excited and open to opportunities and conversations that advance new ways of mobilizing finance and technology to address our climate crisis, especially if they focus on our food system. 
I was born and raised in scarborough - on the eastern edge of toronto - and graduated from the university of british columbia where I studied plant biology, agroecology, and food systems. This is all in gratitude and debt to many communities: the musqueam, squamish and tsleil waututh peoples, whose unceded lands i've settled on; the loran scholars foundation; UBC’s global resource systems; the cansbridge fellowship; shipping container farms of singapore, rice fields of the philippines, the green rooftops and gardens across turtle island, the city of vancouver’s generous bike lanes; crag developers in squamish; mountains, oceans, and forest; my family, friends, partner, and my ancestors in the philippines, who i hope make proud, being in good relations

### as of recent...
- I'm working on a documentary
- I'm spending too much time on my phone, and trying my best not to
- if you were here earlier in the year, yes, I did the triple crown, and it was a good slog

### random things that i am thinking about...
- how climate has become a problem of numbers and accounting - and what happens to all of the people and communities in between?
- how my attention span is trash and yours probably is too and we've all normalized it somehow ??
- being nostalgic about my [travel blog](http://www.adventuringallison.wordress.com)
