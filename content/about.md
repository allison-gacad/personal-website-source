Hey, I’m Allison. I’m a writer, journalist, and very-briefly-technologist. I care deeply about building and supporting climate solutions, especially for our most marginalized populations. I think a lot about the role of technology in our society in a changing climate and have spent some time building technology, being critical of what we’ve built, and dreaming about its future, primarily through the domain of our food system.

I currently work in tech journalism as a writer for the Vancouver Tech Journal. I cover hyper-local tech news, with a particular interest in climate, ag, and social impact technologies. I also work part-time at a startup based out of Beijing and Palo Alto to advance knowledge management for climate solutions. I’m excited and open to opportunities and conversations that advance new ways of building technology to address our climate crisis, especially if they focus on our food system.

I was born and raised in scarborough - on the eastern edge of toronto - and graduated from the university of british columbia in 2021 where I studied plant biology, agroecology, and food systems. This is all thanks to the support of many generous communities: the musqueam, squamish and tsleil waututh peoples; the loran scholars foundation; UBC’s global resource systems; the cansbridge fellowship; shipping container farms of singapore, rice fields of the philippines, the green rooftops and gardens across turtle island, the city of vancouver’s generous bike lanes; crag developers in squamish; mountains, oceans, and forest; my family, friends, and partner.
