Hey, I’m Allison. I’m a journalist, writer, and a filmmaker (just hardly!). I care deeply about building and supporting climate solutions, especially for our most marginalized populations.

I work in climate journalism as an editor at Carbon Pulse, an industry publication where I cover carbon markets and climate policy. I'm fundamentally interested in the economics and politics of climate solutions. I'm based in Vancouver, BC, but have been very lucky to report on UN climate change conferences from Germany, Azerbaijan, and the UAE, so far. 

Some favourite stories:
- Contextualising the challenge of removing CO2 from the atmosphere and [storing it underground in the US Gulf Coast](https://carbon-pulse.com/291505/)
- Diving deep into the mechanics of developing [carbon credits from old-growth forests in British Columbia](https://carbon-pulse.com/258173/)
- Understanding what oil and gas companies [have to say about reducing emissions and why](https://carbon-pulse.com/351333/)
- How China approaches climate diplomacy [now that Trump is in office](https://carbon-pulse.com/413181/)

Previously, I was a writer at the Vancouver Tech Journal (sometimes Victoria and Calgary too), where I covered hyper-local tech news, with a particular interest in climatetech.

Outside of writing I produced and hosted my first films last year - a [six-part docuseries on climate solutions in British Columbia.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClK3Rj-VKSw&list=PLuj3rWl-eKLEfVTHN9xgC2H8wi8oEqPJL) 
This was a really new and difficult but fulfilling experience for me. I would love to produce more films with the right team of people.

I was born and raised in scarborough - on the eastern edge of toronto - and graduated from the university of british columbia where I studied plant biology, agroecology, and food systems. This is all in gratitude and debt to many communities: the musqueam, squamish and tsleil waututh peoples, whose unceded lands i've settled on; the loran scholars foundation; UBC’s global resource systems; the cansbridge fellowship; shipping container farms of singapore, rice fields of the philippines, the green rooftops and gardens across turtle island, the city of vancouver’s generous bike lanes; crag developers in squamish; mountains, oceans, and forest; my family, friends, partner, and my ancestors in the philippines, who i hope make proud, being in good relations

### as of recent...
- I'm trying to write outside of work, and it's hard
- I'm cycling a lot - mostly training for a bike race from Vancouver -> Whistler (122 km, 2300m)
- Soaking up the sun in hopes that I will keep a tan to last year round in the PNW!

### random things that i am thinking about...
- being nostalgic about my [travel blog](http://www.adventuringallison.wordress.com) 
- the strange convergence of my professional and personal identity, especially in the digital age
- feeling old and sentimental in my late 20s.

I'm always happy to chat about journalism, climate, and filmmaking, and open to new creative projects in the domain above. You can reach me at allisongacad [at] gmail [dot] com
